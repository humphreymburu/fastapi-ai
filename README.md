# Chain.py

## This Code In Chain.Py Sets Up A Conversational Retrieval Chain Using Fastapi And Openai For Processing Chat History And Questions. 

Here'S A Breakdown:

###  Imports:
Imports necessary modules like FastAPI, ChatOpenAI, and others.
### Configuration:
Loads environment variables using dotenv.
Defines configuration variables like OPENSEARCH_URL, OPENSEARCH_USERNAME, etc.
### Templates:
Defines templates for rephrasing questions and generating responses as a UNEP expert.
### OpenAI Setup:
Initializes an OpenAI model and embedding function.
### Vector Search:
Sets up OpenSearch for vector search functionality.
### Data Retrieval:
Retrieves data from OpenSearch based on a query.
### Functions:
Defines functions for combining documents and formatting chat history.
### Input Processing:
Processes input data to generate a standalone question using OpenAI.
### Context:
Defines context for the conversational QA chain.
### User Input Model:
Defines a data model for chat history with the bot.
### Conversational QA Chain:
Constructs a pipeline for processing chat history and questions using OpenAI and the defined context.
Overall, this code orchestrates a system for handling conversational interactions by rephrasing questions, retrieving relevant information, and generating expert responses based on the provided chat history and context.


# main.py:

## This code in main.py sets up a FastAPI server to expose a conversational retrieval chain. Here's a breakdown:

### Imports:
Imports necessary modules like FastAPI for building the API server.
#### FastAPI Setup:
- Creates a FastAPI application with a title, version, and description.
### - Routes:
- Adds routes to the FastAPI app for using the conversational retrieval chain under endpoints like /invoke, /batch, and /stream.

### Server Execution:
Runs the FastAPI server using uvicorn on localhost at port 8000.
In summary, this code initializes a FastAPI server that serves as an interface for interacting with the conversational retrieval chain defined in chain.py. It sets up routes for invoking the chain and runs the server to handle requests and responses related to the conversational AI functionality.``
